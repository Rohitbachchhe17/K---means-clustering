# K---means-clustering
# What is Clustering?
Cluster analysis is a technique used in data mining and machine learning to group similar objects into clusters. K-means clustering is a widely used method for cluster analysis where the aim is to partition a set of objects into K clusters in such a way that the sum of the squared distances between the objects and their assigned cluster mean is minimized.

# What Is Clustering?
Suppose we have N number of unlabeled multivariate datasets of various animals like dogs, cats, birds, etc. The technique of segregating these datasets into various groups on the basis of having similar features and characteristics is called clustering.

The groups being formed are known as clusters. Clustering techniques are used in various fields, such as image recognition, spam filtering, etc. They are also used in unsupervised learning algorithms in machine learning, as they can segregate multivariate data into various groups, without any supervisor, on the basis of common patterns hidden inside the datasets.

# What Is K-Means Clustering Algorithm?
The k-means clustering algorithm is an Iterative algorithm that divides a group of n datasets into k different clusters based on the similarity and their mean distance from the centroid of that particular subgroup/ formed.
K, here is the pre-defined number of clusters to be formed by the algorithm. If K=3, It means the number of clusters to be formed from the dataset is 3.
